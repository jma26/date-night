Have you ever had a date and didn't know how to plan it? If you had this problem, Date-Night is your go-to app that does all the planning for you. It's as simple as choosing a cuisine, go-to beverage, and ideal dessert! This project is very similar to Feed-Me-Now with an addition of Redux state management and is the main reason behind this project to become more familiar with Redux.
